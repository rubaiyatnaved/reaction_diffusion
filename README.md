A couple of reaction-diffusion systems are numerically solved using finite-differnece schemes. Time evolution of the solutions show some beautiful patterns being formed.

Reaction-diffsuions systems are partial differential equations used to model many chemical, physical and biological systems. The genral form of a reaction-diffusion system is 

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\alpha_{1}\left(\frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial \mathrm{x}^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} u}{\partial y^{2}}\right)+f(u,v) \\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}=\alpha_{2}\left(\frac{\partial^{2} v}{\partial \mathrm{x}^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2} v}{\partial y^{2}}\right)+g(u,v)
\end{array}\right.
$$
